## Running application

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
